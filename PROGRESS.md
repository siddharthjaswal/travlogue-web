## 🎨 Design Principles

**Every component must:**
1. Use warm, sophisticated colors
2. Have smooth, natural animations
3. Include proper loading states
4. Be accessible (WCAG AA)
5. Feel effortless to use
6. Look like a work of art

**Typography:**
- Clear hierarchy

- Tracking-tight for headings

**Interactions:**
- Hover: Subtle lift + shadow
- Active: Scale 0.98
- Focus: Clear ring
- All transitions: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

**Spacing:**
- Generous padding
- Breathing room
- Not cluttered
